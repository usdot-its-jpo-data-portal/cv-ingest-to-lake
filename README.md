Utilities to work with ITS Sandbox and code for CV pilot data ingestion pipeline (ingestion into ITS Sandbox and from ITS Sandbox to Socrata). For more information on ITS Sandbox data, please refer to the [ITS Sandbox README page](https://github.com/usdot-its-jpo-data-portal/sandbox/tree/split-repo#exporting-data-to-csv-with-sandbox-exporter).

This repository currently includes several utility scripts: Sandbox Exporter, S3 Folder Restructurer, Data Flattener, and Socrata Connector. These utilities uses Python 3.x as the primary programming language and should be able to be executed across operative systems.

## Utilities
### Sandbox Exporter

This utility can be used to download data generated between a specified date range into larger merged CSV or JSON file(s) by using our Sandbox Exporter script.

Example Usage:
- Retrieve all WYDOT TIM data from 2019-09-16:
`python -u sandbox_to_csv.py --pilot wydot --message_type tim --sdate 2019-09-16`
- Retrieve all WYDOT TIM data between 2019-09-16 to 2019-09-18:
`python -u sandbox_to_csv.py --pilot thea --message_type tim --sdate 2019-09-16 --edate 2019-09-18`
- Retrieve all WYDOT TIM data between 2019-09-16 to 2019-09-18 in json newline format (instead of flattened CSV):
`python -u sandbox_to_csv.py --pilot thea --message_type tim --sdate 2019-09-16 --edate 2019-09-18 --json`

#### Configuration
The applications requires [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) or [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) and the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

This application also requires that you have access to the command line of a machine. If you're using a Mac, the command line can be accessed via the [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac), which comes with Mac OS. If you're using a PC, the command line can be accessed via the Command Prompt, which comes with Windows, or via [Cygwin64](https://www.cygwin.com/), a suite of open source tools that allow you to run something similar to Linux on Windows.

##### Prerequisites for using Sandbox Exporter

1) Have your own Free Amazon Web Services account.

	- Create one at http://aws.amazon.com

2) Obtain Access Keys:

	- On your Amazon account, go to your profile (at the top right)

	- My Security Credentials > Access Keys > Create New Access Key

	- Record the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key ID (you will need them in step 4)

3) Have access to Python 2.7 or Python 3.6+. You can check your python version by entering `python --version` and `python3 --version` in command line.

4) Save your AWS credentials in your local machine, using one of the following method:
	- shared credentials file: instructions at https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html#shared-credentials-file.

	--bucket usdot-its-cvpilot-public-data
	--bucket_prefix usdot-its-datahub-
	--folder wydot/BSM/2018
	--outfp wydotBSM2018fps.txt
	--startKey wydot/BSM/2018/11/29/17/usdot-its-cvpilot-bsm-public-4-2018-11-29-17-54-20-2b9afefa-ff32-4b8d-b458-bed83857dd46

```
